# Advent of Code 2022

Here's a Cargo workspace containing all of my solution's to 2022's Advent of Code questions. Each day contains a solution written in Python, as well as a solution written in Rust (yeah, I'm using AoC to learn rust, very original, I know).

Input files have obviously been left out of the repository, but if you wish to run the code with your own input, it is intended to be placed directly within each day's folder, with the filename of `input`.
